Download and extract the following files into this folder ('data'):

- intensiveStationsData.xlsx
- hd_files.hdf5
- hd_files_ma_5.hdf5
- loading.hdf5
- loading_Aurajoki.hdf5

The main installation script attempts to download these automatically (see src/python/download_data.sh).
If this fails, you can try the script again later (by running 'src/python/download_data' on the command line)
download them manually from the following Zenodo repositories:
- https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14028483 (intensiveStationsData.xlsx)
- https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14028432 (.hdf5 files)
